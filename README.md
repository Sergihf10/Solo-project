# The Barbershop

An app to help barbershops to manage their appointments, save them time, and avoid possible conflicts (forgeting an appointment).
Users can register and login as a user, and they will be abble to make the appointment based on the available times, change an appointment already created 
and delete their appointment, all of this without having to communicate with the barbershop.

At the same time, owners can login to see their incomming appointments and changes on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.

For this project I used React, joined with useForms and DatePicker components from React libraries, and plain CSS for the Front-End. 
For the Back-End I used an Express server, with MongoDB and Mongoose.
Finally, the language used was Javascript for both Front and Back-end.
